# NUSurveys (Orbital 2022)

## About NUSurveys

NUSurveys is a centralised survey platform that streamlines the process of disseminating and filling out surveys in the National University of Singapore (NUS). This platform allows both researchers to publicise and market their surveys effectively and students within the NUS community to source for and participate in surveys easily. 

NUSurveys is a project developed over three months for NUS CP2106 (Orbital) 2022. The frontend is built using ReactJS, HTML, and CSS. Supabase was used as our backend service provider to support our database, authentication, and storage.
